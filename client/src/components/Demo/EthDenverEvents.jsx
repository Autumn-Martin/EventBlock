While the ‘death of Google’ or ‘death of search’ is certainly overstated..for now.. the ability for AI to answer questions quickly, thoughtfully, thoroughly and correctly is remarkable.  The next version will undoubtedly be even more powerful and reach tens of millions on its way to billions.  But with this power and reach will come a freight train of scrutiny and controversy.   \nAs these AI engines mature, they will be seen as a source of truth and every society and government has a view as to what ‘truth’ is regarding certain topics.  The answers to delicate questions are already drawing attention; ChatGPT can the benefits of green energy but some users have found it hard to get answers for ‘the benefits of carbon based energy’.  What would it have answered about masking in 2020 when Fauci didn’t recommend it? Would that answer be the same in late 2020 when the CDC strongly recommended masking for everyone?  The sensitivities get even greater in countries with even more charged topics such as in India or Pakistan not to mention with the totalitarian regimes that enforce a particular narrative.  We have already seen the US government’s interest in supporting or limiting certain topics on Twitter and a single source of truth will be even more threatening to governments, politicians and even communities. \nHow can a company or organization possibly manage all of the competing demands regarding particular answers?  We can expect AI engines to be banned in some countries, but where it isn’t banned, it certainly will be the subject of regulation which will erode its credibility and likely will reduce the scope of topics it can address. \nThe first step in reducing company or government influence is an open source AI engine where a community can train the model transparently, and several projects like Bloom and EleutherAI are already in progress.  But training is just the beginning; no matter the inputs, scrutiny will be on the outputs and any organization running the model will be subject to pressure.   The only inoculation from this pressure is to decentralize the actual running of the AI engine by hosting it on a global decentralized network with no owners and no single points of control.  Run on a decentralized network, any storage provider can host the model and any compute provider can process queries. \nThe good news is the technology already exists to make this a reality but how will it be implemented and by whom?  And will an uncensored version be good? What are the drawbacks?\nThe future will likely see multiple AI engines competing to be the source of truth, and that is healthy.  Linux provides a good example of how the global community can build a powerful alternative to centralized companies and the same may happen with AI but as important as building/training the AI.. is the running of it.",

      "description": "This talk expands upon an Op-Ed I published in Coindesk on September 16, 2022. The piece is titled \"How the Ethereum Merge Could Lead to Improved On-Chain Privacy\" (link included below under \"Additional Resource Document). Without further ado:\n\nWhile the Merge has inspired many across the crypto space to rejoice at the prospect of a gas-optimized future, the greater implications of the Merge extend far beyond basic product viability. It is without a doubt that bringing down Ethereum gas fees is absolutely imperative for the network to attract more mainstream users. But what is yet to be seen is the innovation that expanded network capacity will produce. For it would be naive to envisage post-Merge Ethereum as merely a low-friction environment for cheaper, faster decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) minting.\n\nThe Merge will lay the groundwork for a series of powerful scaling upgrades down the line called the Surge and the Verge. These upgrades pave the way for major innovation in computation-heavy decentralized applications – most notably, those that provide protections for on-chain privacy.\n\nConsider a recent and very relevant parallel. In the early days of the “dot-com boom,” the internet was mostly seen and presented as an ultra-efficient tool for communication. This was an enormous value proposition for its time, which today can only be seen as an understatement. Likewise, when infrastructural improvements were planned, they were mostly attributed to their most immediate effects: faster emails, shorter load times and the like. There were also downstream consequences to every improvement to the internet, culminating today in a network that allows for instantaneous information transfer across the globe. In truth, only a small crowd of visionaries were able to see where things were heading and began work developing features like real-time streaming, cloud computing, file sharing, RSS and torrenting.\n\nThese are the innovations that make the vibrant internet landscape what we enjoy today. They paved the way for new applications including social media, dating apps, interactive content streaming platforms, monetization models, e-commerce, personal financial tools and, yes, those obnoxious banner ads that make free web services profitable.\n\nOn this accord, improved on-chain privacy may not be the prime motivation for Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake, but it will likely be its result due to network effects, the reduced cost of computationally-expensive \"zero-knowledge\" transactions and the sheer number of developers focused on privacy solutions.\n\nZero knowledge (zk) proofs have emerged as Ethereum’s magic bullets, as the underlying cryptographic instruments powering not only Ethereum’s leading layer 2 roll-ups, but its most promising and robust on-chain privacy solutions. The only problem: zks are computationally intensive.\n\nBut with the completion of the Merge – and subsequently, the Surge and Verge – Ethereum kicks off a new era of innovation, one powered by robust infrastructure, and guided by uncurbed ingenuity and innovation. The future of Ethereum is as bright as it is cheap, fast and private.",

      "name": "Incentivize what matters: How Decentralized Incentivized APIs will build the Decentralized Public Cloud",
      "description": "The talk argues that APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a critical component for abstracting open-source software and connecting middleware, making them a key component in modern software stacks for both web2 apps and web3 dApps. The growth of Linux led to the rise of open-source software and APIs, and startups and investors moved from proprietary software to open core + SaaS business models. Public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have transformed corporate IT by providing elastic compute, storage, and communication services, but they have also monetized open-source software by layering their own proprietary SaaS stacks on top. This has gutted the open-source startup model, as the open core OSS feeds directly into the cloud provider's revenue instead of the teams who find, build, and maintain the open core portion of the OSS.\n\nThe talk suggests that decentralized incentivized APIs, a tool from blockchain technology, can change this by including decentralized metering and billing as integral features of APIs, allowing for the reconstruction of public clouds in the full image of decentralization. Similar to how gas is used for Ethereum transactions, layer 1 API metering and billing can be trustless machine-to-machine APIs that run in payment state channels coupled to the underlying TCP 1:1 communication. Layer 2 metering and billing systems can be as rich or richer than existing centralized cloud providers, with different forms of freemium and premium business models. The talk suggests that this model should spread throughout the decentralized cloud services model, driving the monetization of OSS and feeding back to accelerating its development. It aims for a multi-protocol and multi-participant world with many datacenters running the DPC (decentralized public cloud) stack and providing services through many protocols and decentralized protocols with their dAPIs.",

My teacher ended the presentation by proudly exclaiming, \"Last year, we raised $200.\"\n$200? I thought, \"There has got to be a way to raise more money. \"\n\nThen, it struck me. Students cared, of course. They wanted to contribute, but large donations needed to come from people with more money. I immediately asked to be excused from class, much to the surprise of my teacher, who knew about my love for animals. She agreed, and I slipped out to call my contact at ETHDenver (Dad.) \n\"Well, it is ambitious! But I think it's doable,\" He said.\n\nThat was all I had to hear. I rushed back into class. As soon as Mr. Johnson finished the presentation, I introduced myself. We hit it off instantly; he loved rhinos, I loved marine iguanas, conservation had consumed his life, and I wanted it to consume mine. Finally, I pitched my idea, knowing somewhere in my mind that I was moving toward my dream faster than I had anticipated.\nI created Conservation Companions, a company to leverage non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to raise money for conservation efforts. We had help from New Frontier Works, Bufficorn Ventures, Penguins International, and the Katie Adamson Foundation.\n\nFast forward to December 2022: We launched the Penguin Incubator Project with Penguins International. We mint NFTs of South African penguin colonies https://ethden.page.link/cc . Each NFT covers the cost of an incubator that can save as many as 180 chicks per year. Everyone who mints a token will get token-gated access to live feeds, an AI-generated and real-life penguin image, and updates from the penguin nests built with the funds from the sale. \nPIP is an excellent example of how Web3 and Blockchain can do enormous good in the world, something we need to show in light of the various exchange scandals this year. All people need are some good examples with significant outcomes. What could be better than saving penguin chicks?",

Existing block explorers and analytics are developing approaches to access on-chain data, but which of these approaches are future-proof?\n\nThis talk will focus on the future of the crypto data experience layer, starting with a review of our historical past and an assessment of the key techniques users can use to gain insights from on-chain data, from encoded, decoded data to an enriched semantic layer.\n\nWe will discuss the impact of AI and in particular Large-Language-Models in creating a future-proof data experience layer, and continue the debate on the idea of a universal crypto data interface. What is the ideal approach and standard that significantly lowers the marginal cost of intelligence while driving large-scale insight exploration?

Marieke will speak about the three pillars of sustainability for blockchains and her efforts to promote these values at NEAR.\n\nThe three pillars of sustainability:\nDiversity - Representation across the spectrum in all subsets of society - race, age, socio-economic background, gender - is key for the adoption and development of blockchains. Hiring decisions should be made with inclusion in mind, to ensure that the development of blockchains is influenced by all demographics and accessible for everyone.  Diversity can also be achieved  by breaking down barriers to tech development by supporting easier to use building applications like java in web3, creating communities to help attract and retain talent, and to actively  promote online training and education. \n\nThe Environment - Considerations for the preservation of our surroundings are key across all industries, but getting it right is even more important for blockchains as they are adopted across sectors. From leading the charge in promoting a proof of stake method over proof of work to leverage blockchain technology for projects that help to preserve and repair our ecosystem, Web3 has an important role to play in saving the planet. \n\nEthics - The traditional approach to achieving a higher ethical standard in an industry is through government regulation that offers checks and balances. Blockchains, however,  don’t really need regulation for they are the solution to ethical shortfalls due to their inherent transparency as a visible ledger. Decentralisation is the way forward - but convincing the sceptics could become the biggest challenge to overcome in 2023 given recent scandals. But the fight to clean up the industry is a battle that must be fought. \n\nMarieke Flament and the NEAR foundation have employed these three pillars to drive impressive growth in the NEAR ecosystem - and she would like to share her experiences with the audience. The NEAR blockchain recently surpassed 250 million transactions and the ecosystem is now the home of over 1000 projects, ranging from Web3 gaming to Music NFTs - one of which was nominated for a Grammy award. NEAR’s success in 2022 - which saw 15x growth in the number of accounts - was a product of building with the three pillars of sustainability at the forefront of each team’s decision making. She can talk about how this was achieved, the lessons she’s learned and what to expect in 2023.",

ChugSplash significantly reduces the amount of code it takes to deploy contracts because it lets you define your deployments declaratively inside of a single file instead of writing deployment scripts.\n• Safe upgrades. ChugSplash simplifies the process of upgrading contracts by displaying the exact variables and lines of code in every modified contract via a git-style diff.\n• Fully secure: Standard deployment scripts are prone to random local errors, unexpected bugs, and dangerous edge cases.

Rug their investment! - come learn about the longest internet shutdown in history and the radical tools being used to disrupt and dismantle the digital imperialism of the Ethiopian Empire.\n\nThis talk will present 2 years of intense hard fought research about the state-sponsored internet blackout against civilian populations in Ethiopia - using Tigray as the main case study. \n\nWith that foundation, we'll look at the crucial roles of blockchains in the Tigray war. How they’re used by the Federal State to effectively track refugees and hunt survivors - while in contrast, Tigrayan civilians use crypto to circumvent the total banking shutdown. The people of Tigray have withstood the longest total siege in modern history and weaponized internet access played a crucial role in maintaining their oppression. Disconnecting Tigray ensured the people lost their ability to represent themselves to the world. When a central authority like the Ethiopian Regime, has the power to deny its victims their rightful voice on the global stage, that authority is now free to abandon all humanity - genocide happens in the dark.\n\nCome workshop with Tigray Internet Freedom DAO - learn about multi-ethnic federalism and how cypherpunk tools are the only way to ensure Tigray is never dark again. \n\nYou might think: “But it’s Ethiopia, that's far away. Why would I care about that??”\n\nHere’s why bestie: Weaponized internet access in 2023 is more of an existential threat to Western cypherpunks than anything else. There exist enough infrastructure options that an effective shutdown is highly unlikely. So the concept of a “weaponized internet blackout” becomes a boogeyman idea rather than an active human rights threat. Consequently, this ideological comfort means you’re all getting soft. Can any of you really say what it’s like living inside a weaponized internet blackout - overwhelmingly no. \n\nHowever, In Tigray Ethiopia, the longest weaponized internet shutdown in history has just BARELY started to lift. As journalists and humanitarians trickle in - the aftermath of the Tigray Region serves as a terrifying testament to the reality of a state-sponsored internet blackout. A reality that should motivate cypherpunks in the West to immediately shake themselves from their comfort - because the 2-year-long internet blackout was endorsed and partially funded by Western governments.

Not only have their been scaling and tooling problems, but there have also been design problems. In the same way that AMM had to reimagine swapping away from order books, on-chain games are similarly exploring niche genres of gaming that are appropriate for the asynchronicity of the blockchain.",

Yet, countless individuals world wide do not have access to affordable credit. A third of American adults could not afford a $1,000 emergency expense. So, if their car breaks down for instance and they need it to go to work they may be forced into a position where they take out a high-interest loan. High-interest consumer loans are a $70 billion market in the United States alone. Within this market payday loans are particularly egregious with average interest rates of 390%. Despite these high-interest rates 12 million Americans on average will take one out every year. Congress in the past has attempted to regulate this market out of existence, but has failed to do so. It is clear a market solution is needed. Ethereum and other blockchains provide the perfect medium for building a solution to this high-interest lending crisis. They are highly transparent and accessible anywhere in the world. Furthermore, they can help solve some of the biggest issues that cause this market to exist such as information asymmetry.",

Instead of giving the proceeds from MEV all to the validator, they can instead choose to share it with the transaction originators. Practically speaking, this could ultimately result in a future where your Ethereum wallet pays you to use it in the form of MEV rebates and/or tokens associated with the transactions you conduct. \n\nThis talk will take a dive deep into how block building sets the stage for #sharethemev, how exactly it may impact you, and what you can do today as a transaction originator to prepare for this future.",

With Externally-Owned Accounts (EOAs), Web3 introduced unprecedented agency and sovereignty to users. The cost, however, was a lot of responsibility: one single key, one single point-of-failure. Lose your key, lose your crypto, and that’s it. \nRecently, a lot of discussions have circled around Account Abstraction, or using smart contracts to decouple “accounts” - an end-user’s digital assets and interactions - from signing. Smart contract Account Abstraction provides a ton of advantages for users, including reducing that single point of failure, improving security, and enabling more sophisticated programmed functionality. \nSmart Contract Account Abstraction is not without its compromises though. Code and engineering risk, interactivity with other dApps, inter-network operability and portability, and affordability, amongst others, would suffer as a result. \nIn this presentation, we’d like to explore what’s Beyond Account Abstraction, and what opportunities we have to employ leading-edge cryptography and infrastructure to achieve the same - or better - features for end-users without such substantial compromises. We’ll introduce and apply concepts like secure multiparty computation (SMPC), various threshold signature schemes, and key resharing to externally-owned accounts, as well as discuss their advantages and disadvantages. \nAt the end of the day, we’re all looking to make Web3 more human-friendly. As a community, we have more tools available than smart contracts and purpose-specific networks. By presenting these concepts in an accessible way, we hope to encourage web3 buidlers to re-examine their assumptions of what’s possible, and continue to work for a safer, more mainstream Web3.",

We have also created a parallel \"crypto focused\" checkout method that utilizes Depay.  The struggle of offering both models is pretty interesting.\n\nIn our case we are minting tokens to represent Penguin Incubators that go directly to funding the creation and maintenance of incubators that support African Penguin populations through a foundation called Penguins International.  The NFTs are then used to token gate content relating to the outcomes created by the incubators as time goes on. We're utilizing a Wordpress plugin to gate the content after minting to allow our tokens to extend beyond our domain and activate a website built in a very standard web2 manner.\n\nDiscuss the struggles of web3 authentication, receiving payment, creating a smooth user experience, and ensuring reliable outcomes would be the general focus of my talk.",

      "description": "The Biology of Token Networks will propose a framework for recognizing patterns across token networks — which are fluid, dynamic systems — providing all web3 builders with more insight into the token design mechanisms that can be used to create successful protocols and networks in the future.\n\nAs context, for years blockchain-oriented communities have been referred to as “ecosystems”, however, our understanding of these ecosystems is not commensurate with their complexity. There is a clear need for a more sophisticated understanding of the numerous, interdependent mechanisms used in the design of token-based networks. Token design as a discipline has been evolving for several years now, and the open, living resource presented during this talk will advance the discipline — helping it to mature beyond the first phase of experimentation, and evolve into a discipline with best practices, and eventually industry standards which are used for designing and engineering token networks. By creating a shared language and taxonomy of design mechanisms being used by entrepreneurs, developers, and designers, will be able to more effectively design for the outcomes they aim to achieve. \n\nOver the past 4 years particularly, there have been massive efforts to increase the shared understanding of token design and blockchain networks. The fruit of those efforts are often captured within incredibly thoughtful papers, blog posts, academic research, videos, and more. These long-form analyses often address the discuss mechanisms and actors in network in a very abstract, academic sense. Additionally, there has been massive progress in the field of blockchain analytics, with successful platforms such as Nansen, Dune Analytics, Chainalysis, and more. However, analytics products provide unopinionated data in bulk, which is generally not tied to the design decisions made in the development of the networks in question. \n\nAs a result, the blockchain space overall has large amounts of structured on-chain data, and deep, nuanced theoretical works. However, when it comes to the task of designing crypto-native networks, there remains a huge gap between the theoretical and the empirical. The subject matter of this talk will aim to close that gap by defining a methodology for analyzing the specific mechanisms best suited to driving particular outcomes for token networks. Much of the information currently available to founders, engineers, and designers doesn’t provide data-driven insights into the mechanisms that have been used in the past across multiple protocols, why they were used, and what the outcomes were as a result. \n\nIn this talk, I’ll propose a framework for capturing and analyzing this data across numerous token networks, establishing the venue for discourse about how organic, ever-changing token networks can be measured as it relates to token design. I expect this to be a foundational starting point, which allows web3 builders across the globe to build upon and refine over time. During the talk I’ll discuss the process of how I arrived at the proposed framework, and propose my view of how it could continue to evolve over time, along with ways in which individuals and organizations can contribute to its development as well. \n\nThe initial framework and data set will consist of a database containing successful web3 protocols/networks, along with:\n- Case studies of each respective token design (Several case studies provided initially as examples)\n- Primary actors within each token network\n- Type of Project and the associated goals of the protocol / network\n- Mechanisms employed (Buy \u0026 Burn, Pass-through Yield, Voting Escrow, etc.)\n- Outcome of each token design, which may include qualitative factors or key metrics such as number of voters on proposals, token price, etc.\n- Scatter plot that exhibits the correlation between mechanisms used by particular networks and the metrics used to measure the success of those networks\n\nThe ultimate goal of this talk is to create an increasingly valuable set of insights to be used in the emerging field of token network design and token engineering. This will be achieved through the open-source data and framework which the broader web3 community can contribute to and continually improve upon over time.",

Sean can discuss how the benefits of DeFi can be accessible to many businesses without requiring a full embrace of crypto, and how payments systems are evolving to blend modern and traditional methods to deliver the best prices and speed for all businesses.",

This talk aims to provide a single and unifying \"north star\" to developers, i.e. a single and simple principle that they can use to answer each question in a consistent and farsighted manner. That principle is: \"incentivize civic behavior sustainably\" or more simply \"solve externalities.\" The talk offers a four-step recipe for protocol developers to operationalize this principle: identify positive and negative externalities, identify the key actors, set up the redistribution mechanism, and calibrate the mechanism's sustainability. I work through examples like governance and airdrops, and I briefly illustrate how some major protocols have embodied this principle. With this, protocol designers can reduce the operational complexity and financial noise around tokenomics, and build for long-term success.",

People conduct a wide variety of activities online including but not limited to communication, research, shopping, banking and finance, entertainment, education, social networking, and work.\n\nAs we integrate aspects of our lives more fully into online experiences, there is an enormous amount of data collected about our behaviors and preferences in these experiences. This data is used to curate more meaningful experiences for us online via platform-specific algorithms that are able to understand and design for us. This data becomes a representation of who we are online — our persona deduced from our online behavior.\n\nPersonalization has traditionally been centered around the behavior of individuals. Companies are using data to tailor their products and services to individual customers’ specific needs and desires. However, with the increasing importance of social alignment, personalization is shifting to become more community-focused, nuanced, and complex. Rather than just considering the preferences of individual users, personalization mechanisms must now also consider the values and beliefs of communities to which those users belong. This shift is partly driven by the importance of social media and other online platforms that allow people to connect easily with like-minded individuals and form communities based on shared interests.\n\nWe at FirstBatch believe in the democratic principles of an open web where users are empowered with a self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, interoperable ID that allows them to use their data to access the best possible experiences and interactions.

These challenges will only get more severe as we move forward in the digital era. In this talk, Prof. Dawn Song will talk about how Web3 technologies including decentralized identities, policy-compliant decentralized computation, and data sovereignty can help provide a paradigm shift to enable users and data owners to maintain better control of their data and get better benefits from their data, and break down data silos and enable data commons for public good through decentralized data science. By combining technologies including secure computing, differential privacy, federated learning, as well as blockchain technologies for data rights, we can build a platform for a responsible data economy, to enable more responsible use of data that maximizes social welfare \u0026 economic efficiency while protecting users’ data rights and enable fair distribution of value created from data.",

I’d discuss a subset of some of the important scholars/works in the space (primarily with an eye towards Marshall McLuhan’s work on media theory) and, using insights from these works, present a definition of “Web3” that build’s on Jay Graber’s definition but is inextricably linked to public goods. And, from this definition, non-exhaustively identify key principles and requirements to consider when building in this space.\n\nAn example of how this could be explored would be to justify the principle of “self-certification” as being core to the Web3 ethos. Then, we identify requirements of “self-certification” from multiple perspectives. Not just the technical requirement of user-controlled cryptography, but “softer”, mission-focused requirements as well.\n\nI would also explore specific protocols and technologies (from DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, to DIDComm and mirror.xyz, AT Protocol and many more) and show how they fit within a principled framework of Web3.\n\nI would conclude with a call-to-action for voluntary cooperation (and the specific steps to take to achieve this) between the major players in this space within the Ethereum ecosystem to support the composability that is foundational to the Open Web.",

An oracle network consisting of a network of independent nodes aims to address this issue by allowing blockchain smart contracts to function over inputs obtained from existing Web 2.0 data, real-world sensors, and computation interfaces. Performing this information exchange securely, however, is not trivial: most of the data sources today do not offer data in a signed form, the oracle network  also becomes vulnerable due to the compromise of a subset of oracle network nodes;  moreover, the adversary may go after the availability of the system (and at times safety) by malevolently slowing down the protocols. We address these issues, and propose a robust and scalable distributed solution for solving the oracle problem. While our approach (DORA) can withstand extreme adversarial settings, we make some real-world synchrony and input-data distribution observations, and introduce oracle execution sharding. In particular, having access to an ordering primitive such as state-machine replication (SMR), we can solve the decentralized oracle arrangement problem with only 51% honest nodes.  This makes our solution scale quite well as the number of oracle services and the size of the oracle network grow.",

The focus is on how these protocols can facilitate continuous liquidity for DeFi assets, and the potential benefits and challenges of this approach.\n\nPerpetual protocols are blockchain-based protocols that enable the creation of perpetual contracts, which are financial instruments that do not have an expiration date. These contracts are similar to traditional futures contracts, but unlike futures, they do not have an expiration date and can be held indefinitely. Perpetual protocols are used in decentralized finance (DeFi) to enable continuous liquidity for assets, such as cryptocurrencies, by allowing users to trade these assets on a decentralized exchange (DEX) without the need for a central counterparty.\n\nThere are several potential benefits to using perpetual protocols in DeFi applications. For example, they can enable the creation of new financial instruments and marketplaces that are not possible with traditional financial infrastructure. They can also facilitate the creation of more efficient and transparent financial systems by eliminating the need for central intermediaries and enabling peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and risks associated with the use of perpetual protocols in DeFi. These protocols are complex and may be prone to technical issues or vulnerabilities, which could have negative impacts on the stability and security of DeFi systems. Additionally, there may be regulatory and compliance challenges associated with the use of these protocols, as they operate in a decentralized and largely unregulated environment.\n\nOverall, the proposal is about exploring the potential of perpetual protocols in DeFi and the benefits and challenges of this approach. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of how these protocols can be used to enable new forms of financial instruments and marketplaces, and how they can facilitate continuous liquidity for DeFi assets.",

Use cases such as digital democracy, personal DeFi, and portable reputation require a mechanism for identities that are richer than Ethereum addresses. To address this need, there are three main approaches: Verifiable Credentials, NFTs (SBT), and naming services (i.e ENS). While NFTs and ENS are easier to adopt and understand by the Web3 community, they do not offer the privacy and interoperability of the Verifiable Credentials approach - a standard defined by W3C and adopted by governments and organizations worldwide.\nAdopting Verifiable Credentials and DID as the identity layer for Web3 has the potential to bridge the gap between Web2 and enterprise applications and bring mass adoption to Ethereum. The challenge, however, is to provide tools that streamline the adoption and implementation of these standards by the Web3 community. These tools should abstract the complexity and provide the necessary privacy and security features required to use these identities on-chain. This is where PolygonID comes in.\nIn this presentation, we will introduce the Polygon ID toolset provided to the Web3 community and go through some of the innovations that allow for the use of off-chain credentials in on-chain transactions.\nWe will also analyze the use cases and possibilities created for existing Web3 applications, such as DAOs, DeFi, and games.",

DAOs allow people around the world to join and collaborate in communities with transparent and enforceable rules.\n\nBut what happens once your DAO reaches a level where it needs legal protection to realize its potential? What happens when a DAO member goes rogue? What are the ethical obligations of the DAO founders to their members? \n\nThis panel will discuss the benefits - and some special considerations - of legal status for DAOs, and why incorporation should be a major consideration for DAOs in 2023. We are planning to bring DAO leads from high profile projects to offer insight into their pathways to legal recognition.\n\nEthDenver attendees are focusing on building the future technology. However, new technology and financial systems will not work without a way for society to successfully collaborate and peacefully exist. DAOs are not incredibly different from the traditional world. Rather, they are an improvement of our current governance systems. \n\nIf this past year has taught the crypto community anything, it is that no matter how regulated and trustworthy something appears, centralized entities can be co-opted, and human greed can be obfuscated. Hopefully, the wakeup calls of 2022 – from Celsius Network to FTX – show the need to decentralize assets and decision-making and will lead to a renaissance in DAOs. With accelerating investment in DAO tooling, DAOs will become leaner and more efficient and be as frictionless to participate in during a normal day as checking your Telegram messages. One way to get to this next level is to make the necessary handshake with the existing legal system in order to enable DAOs to mature and integrate with the rest of the global economy.

The good news is there is a relatively simple solution: giving them basic incomes. This has been done on small scales, and generally works well. The bad news is that to give everyone in extreme poverty a basic income, we’d need ~$311 billion/year. \n\nCurrently, these basic incomes are funded by charitable donations. But that’s not going to cut it: total overseas giving, both private and public, from all countries combined, is $243 billion/year. So even if 100% of that were directed to basic incomes (highly unlikely) it’s not enough.\n\nCan we find other sources of money to lift people out of extreme poverty?

I will discuss the challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the successes we achieved while building this infrastructure. I will also delve into the importance of distributing nodes around the world, the criteria we use to measure our success, and what comes next.\n\nAt [Gateway.fm](http://gateway.fm/), we have been supporting Gnosis Chain in their ambition to become the most decentralized and distributed network in the industry. Our infrastructure is distributed, portable and able to handle billions of requests with high availability.",

They had to work within the confines of an extremely generic system. \n\nIt is time we migrate to a new model that favors smaller independent nodes, each with a custom array of tooling and customs. With the proper leeway to cater to their specific cultures and practices, these community nodes can finally become three dimensional. 3D communities are defined by their ability to provide a holistic experience to their members. They’ve moved beyond being simple chat rooms. They are becoming like cities: built to serve multiple needs of their members. Make a friend, learn something new, get a job, find a collaborator, be entertained, invest your money.\n\nWhat will be possible in this new future? What’s causing it? How can we anticipate the new opportunities and challenges that will arise from it?\n\nTim, Reka, and LDF sit down to discuss this topic from their perspective as builders of communities and community tools.",

However, modern “dApps” have big problems related to data. Not everything can be built on the blockchain: it's expensive and slow.

It powered Terra’s DeFi ecosystem.\nAnd Composable Finance is even running CosmWasm contracts on a Polkadot parachain.\n\nCosmWasm is also the first multi-chain native smart contract engine, allowing contracts to directly interact with other\nchains by defining custom IBC protocols. For example, a DAO on Juno can vote to issue an NFT on Stargaze, and place\nprotocol-owned liquidity to it’s pools on Osmosis. It is also being used to build out Mesh Security, a decentralized,\nmulti-chain future for PoS chains to share security bidirectionally.\n\nWe would love to introduce the Ethereum community to CosmWasm and invite them to learn more; whether it is\ngetting inspiration for eWasm, or potentially integrating CosmWasm alongside the EVM in a layer 2 rollup.",

The bulk of these laws were written and enacted in the 1950s and 1990s. And Ethereum was nothing but a twinkle in Vitalik's eye the last time the UCC saw any meaningful amendment. So the UCC, like many US laws, is outdated and ill equipped to handle the unique asset class that is virtual currency, digital tokens, or NFTs. \n\nHowever, this may soon change. On July 13, 2022, the Uniform Law Commission and American Law Institute jointly approved amendments to the UCC, creating a new Article 12 designed to govern the transfer of property rights in digital assets (or what the UCC will call controllable electronic records (CERs)). If states begin to pass their own versions of Article 12 in the near future, then we will see a significant shift in the legal rules of Defi, NFTs, and any digital asset falling into the new CER category. Most notably, the new amendments will (i) add a technology-neutral functional equivalent of “possession” focusing on control of an digital asset, (ii) create safe-harbor rules for down-stream good faith purchasers of stolen digital assets, and (iii) clarify a lender's best route to create or perfect a security interest in digital assets. \n\nAll of these changes will need to be noted and incorporated into the way we think about our contracts (both smart or written). \n\nMy proposed talk will be a breakdown of the existing laws and where they fall short.

But there is nothing stopping you from leaving the presentation and focusing on something more uplifting if you prefer that sort of thing.\n\nWith all due respect,\nBianca Buzea\n\nThis presentation will cover the history of hacks and thefts in the blockchain space.

      "description": "TLDR; The study delves into how people strive to meet very human needs, rearranging their work, families, and lives, to do what they do, in the ways they do them, in web3. \n\nThe study is full of fascinating aspects, but one area that I’d like to highlight in the talk is how people meet emotional needs in web3 virtual communities. There are changes in the ways people attain a sense of belonging, as well as, purpose. This changes the way that they develop psychologically and how they feel. \n\nThere are some things that the \"outside world\" could learn from the experiments that happen in DAOs. There are also some things in DAOs that prove to be lacking, such as ability to achieve a sense of stability in meeting basic needs. For example, the study shows that conditions of heightened uncertainty, cause stress, mental health side effects, and even lead to burnout. \n\nI will prepare a highlights reel for the talk to review a sampling from the report results \u0026 discussion chapters.\n\nI think it’s important to spend time considering the human side of all of the change that web3 ushers in. When we study the human side, we get to know what is being received on the other side of all of this tech that we are building, to hopefully make the world better. Studies like \"Las Voces of DAO Contributors\" can help designers of communities, tooling, tokenomics, and participants to build for a better lived experience. These insights can also aid individual contributors to manage their engagements in the most intelligent way for them. For instance, contributors can feel validated knowing that feelings they experience are common, such as \"imposture syndrome\" and then find access frameworks to help them to self-advocate, even when they don't feel completely certain in their abilities.\n\nAs Las Voces prepares to release this report in 2023, we've just put up a website to answer more of people's questions about the research and how it was conducted in a scientific way. That site is available at lasvoces.co. If you catch us on a day when we are transferring the domain (happening the week this application is due), you can find the website at lasvoces.squarespace.com.

      "name": "Blending the Best of Hierarchies and Networks: An Organizing Structure for DAOs",
      "description": "Hierarchies have been the dominant organizational structure in the most recent era of organizations due to the specific capabilities they offer. They are able to efficiently pursue and accomplish specific, well-defined ends, such as completing discrete projects and maintaining key functions for day-to-day work. And they are predictable and stable, so contributors know what they can expect, and activities can be forecast well in advance.\n\nHowever, hierarchical structures are often limited in their ability to address complex and multifaceted issues. In the face of complexity, the triangular structure turns into a bottleneck. When an organizing structure is predefined and inflexible, there is little room for collective discovery, spontaneous collaboration, and unforeseen innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, the high concentration of power within hierarchies means that certain groups at the top have enduring structural advantages and are rewarded far more compared to those lower in the organization. These structures perpetuate inequities and dissuade those with less power from fully engaging.\n\nAt their core, DAOs operate with a recognition that such a high concentration of power creates wide vectors for capture of our communal resources, and hinders our ability to pool our resources to solve our biggest problems. Consequently, DAOs have evolved to address the core issue of capture resistance, leading them to take a network approach to collaboration and favor collective decision-making over unilateral control.\n\nNetworks are very good at combining diverse perspectives to discover new possibilities, activating large numbers of people, and adapting quickly to respond to opportunities and threats. But networks—particularly as they grow large and diffuse—struggle to achieve clarity on roles and responsibilities, hold people accountable to their commitments, and explicitly delegate to and revoke authorities from individual members. As a result, they are rarely able to get things done with the same level of efficiency as hierarchical structures. This is why many DINOs (DAOs-in-name-only) have deliberately sacrificed distribution of power, and therefore capture resistance, in favor of control by an executive council.\n\nNeither hierarchical nor network structures are sufficient on their own to meet the varied needs of DAOs, which seek to engage large numbers of people to achieve common goals while expressing the decentralization of power and the autonomy of individual actors. What's missing from DAOs is the ability to get things done without resorting to the power-over structures of traditional organizations.\n\nThe most successful DAOs of the next decade will blend the best of hierarchical and network structures in order to coordinate effectively at scale while reinforcing the autonomy of individual members. These DAOs will cultivate diverse communities of contributors that experience high degrees of trust without relying on trust to get things done. These DAOs will tap into the self-organizing potential of networks, while also creating dynamic hierarchical structures that excel in carrying out the work of the organization. They will be able to integrate the interests of the parts and the whole, coordinating multiple parts to advance the interest of the whole system, without sacrificing the autonomy of the parts in the process. This talk will describe what practices and tools DAOs can use to integrate the best of hierarchies and networks, embracing both individual autonomy and collective coordination to create a harmonious relationship between the parts and the whole.",

      "description": "Decentralized games built on Ethereum almost all make use of a client/server architecture with the blockchain’s nodes themselves acting as the decentralized game server. Individual client dApps send commands or moves to it via transactions and then query the chain for results after those transactions are included in a block. This works well enough, but the very nature of blockchain technology places some limitations on these games. Block mining times limit the speed of player interaction, and per-move transaction costs can make it expensive to play.\n\nMuch work has been done to improve the situation, and even more is in progress. But these improvements are incremental, and as things stand now it is impractical to implement a typical casual multiplayer game with this blockchain-as-a-server architecture.\n\nApian is a different architecture, protocol, and mindset (plus a whole lot of code) for building, scaling, and deploying multiplayer games. Under Apian there is no game server, and instead devices running the game create a peer-to-peer network in which they all communicate with one another and collectively handle the tasks that otherwise would be a server's responsibility. Since the gameplay and consensus computations are rapidly done by the peers themselves at real-time network speeds, it is only the result of this agreement that needs to eventually be reported to the chain.\n\nApian’s consensus protocol implementations are separate from game code and all answer the same API. This allows each particular game to choose between any available consensus protocol on-the-fly to tailor performance/security trade-offs at runtime based on how its being played. We’ll demo a running TRON-like racing game built on Apian. \n\nConsensus protocol implementations under Apian are separate from game code, and all answer the same API, so a game can choose between any available consensus protocol on-the-fly at runtime.

This talk introduces a policy strategy for how policymakers can embrace the good while squashing the bad—in part, by building on past examples, such as the notorious Section 230 for social media and the SEC’s doctrine of protecting “sufficiently decentralized” networks. Colorado’s co-op DAOs (like ETHDenver’s SporkDAO!) demonstrate both the need and opportunity for ensuring that policy encourages, rather than squashing, the side of crypto that has a shot at being good for the world.",

The launch of ZPrize united the leading web3 and ZKP projects with traditional hardware behemoths like Samsung and AMD to create and open source new solutions for ZK hardware acceleration. 32 sponsors contributed $7M to fund 12 prizes, and 70 unique competitors competed in the various categories. The results of this competition presented a significant breakthrough in hardware performance that improved efficiency of core zero-knowledge algorithms by a factor of 5, on average. Because ZPrize focuses on fundamental algorithms instead of a specific company or protocol, these results are broadly applicable and all of the work will be open-sourced for the industry to build and iterate upon.\n\nOur goal is to take zero-knowledge cryptography beyond the realms of theory and research and squarely into the realm of practical applications— from digital stablecoins, privacy-preserving machine learning, digital identity, gaming and more. \n\nJoin the half-day ZPrize summit dedicated to building more mature ZK infrastructure and an ecosystem that fosters true innovation.

      "description": "The emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) has significantly altered the construct of crypto markets, resulting in the rapid growth of the global DeFi sector. Nevertheless, one of the primary drawbacks of DeFi in its current form is high volatility of yield, which can lead to substantial losses for both users and the emerging market. DeFi relies on crypto assets that are intrinsically volatile and susceptible to significant price fluctuations within a brief period, exposing users to unpredictable price movements, volatile yields and potential losses.\n\nThe answer to  these issues is adoption of RWAs in the Defi industry. Using Real World Assets (RWAs) and their yield, the crypto market can promote widespread adoption of DeFi while benefiting industry players with reliable fixed yields. Incorporating tangible assets such as real estate, commodities, bonds and stocks into the DeFi ecosystem enables a broader range of users to participate in the market without requiring specialized knowledge of digital assets. Such a move can create a more diverse and inclusive DeFi ecosystem, allowing ordinary individuals and businesses to partake in the emerging financial system.\n\nGiven the impressive growth of the DeFi industry, which has reached a value of $50 billion within two years, and the potential of RWA and RWA yield, the industry's growth can be further enhanced. Moreover, rather than being restricted to crypto degens, DeFi can become an all-encompassing financial system that benefits unbanked and underbanked across the globe.\n\nIt is imperative to concentrate on building a DeFi ecosystem accessible to all and leveraging decentralized technology to make DeFi genuinely available to everyday people and businesses. In addition, the time has come to construct a more inclusive and equitable financial system that benefits the DeFi industry and the broader financial landscape.",

The original intention of crypto was to shift traditional power structures in the name of a frictionless global economy. The first step crypto platforms must take towards creating a more inclusive system is to reduce the barriers to access that are prolific within the industry today.\n\nMy talk walks through the following:\n\n1. A brief background of my career in digital and financial inclusion, having been responsible for driving user onboarding and adoption of complex technologies (anecdote: I’ve taught the Amish how to do business transactions with iPads)\n2. What is financial inclusion?\n3. Why something like Defi has the innate power to reduce barriers to access\n4. The gap between where crypto is today vs its potential (spoiler alert: we’re far from it)\n5. How far? (show examples of how todays technologies use sophisticated reading levels, countless acronyms, a crypto-specific lexicon that doesn’t exist in the dictionary. \n6. Decentralized platforms = decentralized support (and 5 reasons why this is inhibiting growth and adoption)\n7. What can builders do about this? Aka what can users expect in the next year or two?\n    1. Relatable stories that explain the real-word use cases (that people *actually* get excited about)\n    2. Increased usability\n    3.

With remote cross-chain EVM calls now live on the testnet, devs can now send an XCM message from a remote chain containing a contract call to be executed on Moonbeam's EVM. \n\nIn this workshop, I'll introduce the technical bits of how XCM works and how remote EVM calls work. We'll go through the steps of generating a derivative account on Moonbeam that we'll control remotely via XCM. Then, we'll jump into crafting our remote EVM call - we'll initiate a swap on a Uniswap-style Dex to take place all from a remote chain. I'm so excited about demoing this because it represents the vision of seamless cross-chain interoperability coming to life. I'll be sure to leave time at the end of the workshop for Q\u0026A - as this is a complex topic I expect at least a few questions :)",

Once we are all set up, and depending upon audience interests, we can then work through more custom setups with either a focus on Reinforcement Learning or testing trading strategies in a realistic living market.\n\nThis workshop will be based on https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega-market-sim with additional references to https://github.com/msabvid/cpm_agent_based_sim. \n\nWorking through the setup on the Vega Market Sim repo will give a great headstart in the workshop.",

      "description": "This talk will focus on showcasing the challenges of relying on centralized cloud providers, and the promise of decentralized cloud infrastructure for protocols. It will have charts, numbers and analysis to back up all claims. It's important that Web3 protocols are not just decentralized in name but decentralized in infrastructure for costs, resiliency and performance. Summary below: \n\nCloud is one of the greatest shifts in the history of computing. For the first time in history, organizations didn’t have to deal with the technical burden and costs of running their own infrastructure. Instead, they could rely entirely on a cloud that offered infrastructure on-demand, at any scale, to organizations of any size, driving efficiencies and economics. The cloud industry is growing rapidly growing rapidly on a base of over $100B of annual public cloud spend. \n\nYet, what started out as the most efficient and economical way to scale has become the largest area of spend for many Web2, and dare I say Web3 companies operating at scale. We will get to Web3, but first, focusing on Web2. The longterm cost implications of shifting entirely to cloud is costing Web2 companies billions of dollars each year. “Across 50 of the top public software companies, an estimated $100B of market value is being lost among them due to cloud impact on margins.” a16z. They could be saving billions of dollars they had run their own infrastructure or taken a hybrid approach to their infrastructure. Not only is it a challenge when it comes to costs, but these organizations get cloud vendor lock-in, and it’s difficult to move their tech stack or start from scratch once they’ve reached scale. \n\nWeb3 protocols are in their early days, and the decisions they make when it comes to infrastructure is critical. Many protocols today are dealing with the same challenges that Web2 companies face with large cloud providers, and they are looking for ways to decentralize while they try to scale or die. There are challenges with operating costs, lock-in and an inability to operate efficiently with the hardware that cloud providers offer. Web3 protocols and their infrastructure ecosystem (node runners, operators, shakers, future zk provers, etc.) have to consider not only the short term ease of spinning up on a cloud provider, but the longterm implications for their protocol. \n\nThis talk will start off by covering the above, and then it will go into an analysis of different infrastructure options and their associated challenges, benefits, costs. In contrast to the centralized cloud providers Web2 companies and many Web3 companies rely on to start running infrastructure, there is are infrastructure options that are decentralized, align with the values of Web3 while saving protocols money now and in the future. \n\nThis will not highlight any specific Web3 company -- just compare and contrast data and analysis of different infrastructure options.",

From our work on privacy tools with DAOs and organizations, there's been heavy skepticism of introducing any privacy into the orgs as people love Dune Dashboards and orgs being able to be tracked as well as whales and snooping.\nFrom beta testing with individual users to general stats on Aztec Connect for private DeFi (only about 1/5th the size of ZK Sync), there is clear evidence that privacy does not have the same traction as others.\n\nSo then the question is why?

Part II will present the tradeoffs between PoW and PoS: the history, the strengths and weaknesses of each system, with a bit of Ethereum history, Ethereum's motivation for switching, and a discussion of the Merge and how the Eth Beacon chain works. Part III will present some \"outside the box\" alternatives to PoW and PoS, such as Solana's \"proof of history\" and Spacemesh/Chia/Filecoin's approach using proofs of space-time. Again, the tradeoffs around these mechanisms will be discussed and they'll be presented in the context of running, production networks. The conclusion will talk about implications for the application layer and for dapp developers: ways in which the consensus mechanism \"leaks\" through the abstraction boundaries and impacts UX and DevEx, and ways in which applications themselves can make use of consensus.",

Imagine a world in which all internet assets, such as websites and applications, including mass market social media services and their data, enterprise solutions, etc., are hosted fully on-chain, where they are built exclusively from smart contracts, without need for Web2 integrations of any kind. This would be a great advance on prevailing Web3 and DeFi architectures that are often dependent on a variety of Web2 integrations—including the use of centralized cloud computing services such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services—to make their services available to end-users. The Internet Computer, however, is making these points of centralization obsolete for those building Web3 and DeFi to fully decentralize their systems—allowing for a truly decentralized Internet from end-to-end.\n\nEthereum and the Internet Computer network are a dream combination, which together can fully realize the World Computer vision. New cryptography enables code running on the two networks to be transparently integrated.\n\nIf you’re building Web3 services and are dependent on Web2 integrations of any kind (e.g. hosting a Web2 website to serve your products and services), come learn about how you can build your entire ecosystem fully-on-chain and free yourself from Web2! End-to-end decentralization is possible on the Internet Computer, including native integration with ECDSA tokens (e.g. ETH + BTC!) \n\nIn this talk, Jan will address the SporkDAO community and other audience members on how the crypto community can build their products and services 100% on-chain without the need for Web2 integrations, go fully on-chain and fully realize the World Computer vision.",

Meanwhile, centralized players in crypto have been plagued with non transparent fraudsters, most recently at Celsius and FTX. However, DeFi keeps working and its on-chain proof of reserves couldn't be more transparent. It’s clear that the need for safe, stable money has never been more important. Reserve Protocol lets anyone (that's YOU!) create baskets of asset-backed currencies (what we call RTokens) using anything in DeFi. We're celebrating Reserve's All-Clear milestone (passing many rigorous code audits) with over $70k in prizes and free lunch. Join us Mar 1st at The Red Barber from 10am-5pm.
