# About
[EventBlock.io](https://EventBlock.io/) is a decentralized calendar dApp with editable events stored on-chain. It is built with custom solidity and Open Zeppelin authentication, deployed on Near via Aurora bridge, works with MetaMask, and has a frontend in React deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). EventBlock can be used by DAOs to mint a calendar for community events, track governance, and follow NFT mints. The team is applying for various bounties, including deploying a dApp on an L2 using Infura and Truffle, and deploying a decentralized frontend component for any Ethereum project or hack on Aurora.

# Tech
EventBlock was built with:
- [Aurora](https://aurora.dev/)
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Truffle Box](https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/react/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)

# Production
This project is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with contiunuos integration support via GitHub.

Set environment variables in the Netlify Build:
```sh
INFURA_KEY=
MNEMONIC=
```
Netlify build settings:
- Runtime: Not set
- Base directory: Not set
- Build command: cd truffle && yarn install && cd ../client && echo "REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ENV=production" >> .env && yarn install && yarn build
- Publish directory: client/build

Explanation of the build command:
```sh
# Install truffle dependencies
cd truffle && yarn install &&
  # Move to client directory
  cd ../client &&
  # Manually add an env var (this particular one didn't show up without this)
  echo "REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ENV=production" >> .env &&
  # Install client dependencies and build
  yarn install && yarn build
```

# Development
This project includes a Makefile. Run `make` to list all available commands.

## 1. Setup
Install dependencies:
```sh
make setup
```
Then update env vars in `truffle/.env` with your own.

Hereafter, new dependencies can be installed with: `make install`.

## 2. Deploy
### Devnet
```sh
# Open a separate terminal and run Ganache,
# a simulated Ethereum blockchain on your machine.
ganache

# Keep Ganache running and open another terminal.
# Compile and deploy contracts to Ganache.
make dev_deploy
```

### Aurora testnet
Run: `make test_deploy`.

## 3. Connect Metamask
Set up a separate browser profile with its own clean extension installation of Metamask for developing than the one you typically use.

Then enable test networks in Metamask:
</br>
Settings > Advanced > Toggle "Show test networks"


### Devnet
> ðŸ’¡ Explorer: [Ganache's built in block explorer](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

Ganache outputs a list of pre-funded test accounts that you can import. Alternately, you can specify an account to fund when you run ganache with an option like `-m` ([docs](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache#documentation)).
Then switch Metamask to the Localhost 8545 network.

### Testnet
> ðŸ’¡ Explorer: [Aurora testnet explorer](https://explorer.testnet.aurora.dev/)

[Add Aurora testnet to metamask](https://doc.aurora.dev/interact/metamask/#connecting-metamask-to-aurora). Then get funds from the [Aurora facet](https://aurora.dev/faucet) (select "devnet").

## 4. Start Client
Run `make start_client`.

## Testing
Run `make test`.

# Challenges faced
Infura, Truffle, and Ganache were very easy to work with. This combo enabled us to get up and running quickly locally, even with no prior experience of working on Solidity. The docs were an excellent resource, and overall we had a great experience with them. Our challenges arose when we were trying to adapt from what we had working locally to deploy to Netlify. As a team new to solidity, getting our contract verified onchain for the OpenZeppelin Defender bounty took some digging to figure out. Deploying also took far more effort than we expected. More docs on deploying and verifying a Solidity contract would be greatly appreciated. We were able to get it working, eventually https://defender.openzeppelin.com/#/admin/contracts/auroratest-0xAeb9b07A09EC3c7c604418eC3f6b0CfdA42e0E93
